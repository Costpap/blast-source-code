## How to set up bot

1. Go to the dev portal and make a bot, invite the bot to the server while getting it's ID and Token and inserting those into the correct places in the botconfig.json file.

2. Invite bot to server where you want to use it. Get the ID of that server, and shove it into the botconfig.json file, if you don't errors will be thrown in console.

3. Put owner id(s) in the botconfig.json file and a wanted prefix, plus the ID of the role you need for users to have in order to use the bot. Any bug hunters that will try to use the bot will have the bot reply to them basically saying you don't have the required role in order to use the bot.

4. Get bot online, make sure you have node v10.8.0+ and open console in VSC window. (Put node . in console and bot SHOULD run).

5. Any bugs, questions, or issues will be redirected to xTeal#7702.
